Flixel Power Tools
==================

Version 1.9 (final release)

November 28th 2013

By Richard Davey, [Photon Storm](http://www.photonstorm.com)

The [Flixel Power Tools](http://www.photonstorm.com/flixel-power-tools) are a package
of classes designed to provide extra functionality to your Flixel 2.5+ games.


Quick Install Guide
-------------------

Copy the `src` and `lib` folders into your ActionScript project. All the classes for Flixel Power Tools should be contained in

	src/org/flixel/plugin/photonstorm

Now read the "Getting Started Guide" in the `Docs` folder; it contains important information that will 
help you compile!


Getting Started Guide
---------------------

There is a comprehensive Getting Started Guide in both Word and PDF format in the `Docs` branch:

https://github.com/FlixelCommunity/Flixel-Power-Tools/tree/docs

Documentation is also provided built-in to the classes. AS3 IDEs such as FlashDevelop will
provide context-sensitive help for all classes and functions in the Flixel Power Tools.

Finally check out the home page at http://www.photonstorm.com/flixel-power-tools for updates.


Test Suite
----------

Get the full Test Suite from here:

https://github.com/FlixelCommunity/Flixel-Power-Tools/tree/test-suite

The Flixel Power Tools come with a comprehensive Test Suite. Use it to visually see the 
tools in action, and then learn from the source code and comments within.

To run the Test Suite launch the following SWF:

    Test Suite/bin/FlixelPowerTools.swf

If you don't have Flash Player installed locally then open `index.html` in a browser.

Contributing
------------

I'm afraid that the Flixel Power Tools are no longer maintained by myself. I have moved on to [other things](http://phaser.io).

I would strongly suggest you start using the [Flixel Commmunity](https://github.com/FlixelCommunity) version of Flixel which contains updated versions of these tools.
